Group 1 (Michael and Kaitlyn). Obtain all SARS Coronavirus 2 sequences in GenBank as a DNA FASTA File and as a Protein FASTA file 

Group 2 (Joseph and Gretta). Decide what software will be used to analyze protein coding sequences (CD-HIT) or functional characteristics of protein FASTA file

My suggestion is to focus the study on the more essential sequences...(i.e the ones that appear divergent and/or from different regions as an example); though this will be based on the phylogenetic assessments.

Cd-hit forms clusters of proteins based on the underlying assumption of shared functions.  

A broad goal for the assessments is to determine "divergence in protein coding" so using Cd-hit we can set the parameters between 60-90% homology and determine how the protein clusters differ from one level (i.e 60% to 70%) to the next.  

As an extension of Cd-hit, we can also generate motifs using a motif finding tool (there are many options but Meme is one possibility); these would highlight a particular set of protein clusters (once identified from cd-hit) and we could check if the motifs discovered show us a pattern in the binding site or other locations across the protein sequence.
