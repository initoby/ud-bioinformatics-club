## Friday, March 27th 2020:

Group 1 (Michael and Kaitlyn). Obtain all SARS Coronavirus 2 sequences in GenBank as a DNA FASTA File and as a Protein FASTA file 

Group 2 (Joseph and Gretta). Decide what software will be used to analyze protein coding sequences (CD-HIT) or functional characteristics of protein FASTA file

## Friday, April 3rd 2020:

*Gameplan*
1. Make phylogenetic tree of all COVID-19 sequences and BLAST (non-COVID-19) sequences (Kaitlyn)
2. Perform CD-HIT analysis on protein coding (or non-coding) sequences (Christian)
3. Find motif differences between clusters (Joseph)

## Friday, April 10, 2020:
1) Kaitlyn - filter for final strains to be used in analysis (strains will be filtered based on geographical location information) and add extra strains from Dr. Toby's initial tree + Alphacoronavirus, murine, pigeon, mouse, bat from "Coronavirus" search in Genbank
2) Kaitlyn - mass phylogenetic assessment
3) Everyone - take a look at clades and look for interesting patterns
4) Joseph/Christian - Use accession # from Kaitlyn's tree strains, download protein FASTAs for each accession #, and merge all files into 1.
5) Christian - Perform CD-HIT on mother-of-all FASTA and change cutoff to see how # of clusters changes.
