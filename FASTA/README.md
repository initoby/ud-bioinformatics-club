## Instructions to use Python on Jupyter
1) Upload FASTA files with the titles "human_only_MOA_fastas_86.txt" and "MOA_fastas_96_genomes.txt" into this folder.
2) Upload this folder into Jupyter.  Thus, in Jupyter's root directory, there will be a "FASTA" folder.
3) Edit Parse.py to reflect which file you want to parse and output.
4) In the index.ipynb in the root directory of Jupyter, add a code cell that contains this command: %run -i '/FASTA/Parse.py'
5) Repeat steps 3-4 for the other file
